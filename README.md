# OCR using LeNet-5 ANN Architecture

This project demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the classic LeNet-5 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture. Implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebook, it provides a hands-on approach to character recognition from images, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **LeNet-5 Model Implementation:** Builds and trains a convolutional neural network based on the renowned LeNet-5 design, originally developed for handwritten digit recognition.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Includes steps for cleaning and preparing input images to optimize recognition accuracy.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Guides users through model training, validation, and performance assessment with visualizations.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Covers the complete pipeline from data loading to making predictions on new images.
- **Interactive Exploration:** All steps and results are documented and visualized within Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive code, analysis, and visualization.
- **Python** – (Within Notebooks) Data handling and model implementation.
- **TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch)** – Deep learning frameworks for building and training the ANN.
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** – Data processing and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/not-saad-zahid/OCR-using-LeNet5-ANN-Architecture.git
    ```
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to run the model and experiment with OCR.

## Dataset

The project typically uses standard datasets for OCR tasks, such as MNIST or your own custom data. Please refer to the notebooks for dataset download or setup instructions.
